## 🔧 Backend Setup

### **FastAPI Backend**

Receives sensor data from the device and serves the latest reading to the frontend. Provides simple auth (register/login) backed by Supabase Postgres.

### **Endpoints**
- `POST /data` — accept JSON sensor payload
- `GET /latest` — return latest reading or {"status": "no data yet"}
- `POST /auth/register` — body: { email, password }
- `POST /auth/login` — body: { email, password }

### **Setup Instructions**

1) Create and activate a virtual env, then install deps:

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2) Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill SUPABASE_URI and SECRET_KEY.

3) Run the API:
```bash
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000 --reload
```

### **Sensor payload example**
```json
{
  "voltage": 12.34,
  "current": 1.23,
  "temperature": 30.5,
  "latitude": 37.4219983,
  "longitude": -122.084
}
```

Arduino/ESP32 should POST JSON with `Content-Type: application/json` to `http://<backend-host>:5000/data`.
